# The ESTNeT library for OMNeT++

This is the repository of the Event-driven Space-Terrestrial Network Testbed (ESTNeT).

ESTNeT is a library for OMNeT++ and is mainly designed for the simulation of the wireless communication in networks of satellites and ground stations. Furthermore it allows the simulation and analysis of other parts of satellite systems such as power generation and attitude control.

Further information on ESTNeT can be found in the following paper: https://doi.org/10.1007/s12567-020-00316-6
